<what_currently_exists?>
A Next.js application with a significant amount of UI scaffolding has been built. The core structure is in place, but most features lack backend functionality.

- **Homepage**: A functional, multilingual (English, Urdu, Sindhi) homepage with a static hero slider, marquee text, and navigation links. The language switcher is operational.
- **Public Pages**: UI-only placeholder pages have been created for: Introduction, Saints, Books, Events, Gallery, Contact, Audio, Videos, and News. These pages are accessible via the homepage navigation but display static, hardcoded content.
- **Admin Panel**: A non-functional admin area exists with a login page, a dashboard, and management pages for Books, Events, Gallery, Slider, Audio, News, and Saints. The UI is present but there is no authentication and no CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality implemented.
- **API**: A single API route file  exists but contains minimal logic, mostly returning empty arrays for initial page loads. No CRUD endpoints are implemented.

<Last_working_item>
- Last item agent was working: The agent was addressing a user request to review the project for missing features from the original requirements. It identified that the Admin section for Saints, the News/Press Releases section, and the Visits page were missing. It then proceeded to create the UI scaffold for these pages. It successfully created , , and .
    - Status: IN PROGRESS

<All_Pending/In_progress_Issue_list>
  Issue 1: Public navigation links on the homepage for Audio and Video are not yet added to the main navigation bar and quick links.
  Issue 2: The multilingual content is currently managed by a large, hardcoded JSON object within the main . This is not scalable and will be difficult to manage.

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: The agent added the public-facing pages but forgot to add the corresponding links to the homepage navigation components ( and  arrays in ).
     - Next debug checklist:
        - Edit .
        - Add entries for 'Audio' and 'Video' to the  and  constant arrays, ensuring the  points to  and  respectively.
        - Add translations for these new items in the  object.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will make the newly created Audio and Video pages accessible to users from the homepage.
     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? Y (The agent previously had to fix all other navigation links in a separate step).
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2:
     - Attempted fixes: None. This is the initial implementation approach.
     - Next debug checklist:
        - Propose a refactor to the user.
        - Suggested approach: Create separate JSON files for each language (e.g., , , ).
        - Use a library like  or a custom hook to load the appropriate language file based on the selected language state.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?: This will decouple translations from component logic, making the codebase cleaner and content management much easier, especially when the admin panel is built out.
     - Status: NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

</In_progress_Task_List>
<Upcoming_and_Future_Tasks>
Upcoming Tasks:
- **P0: Implement Full CRUD for Admin Panel**: This is the most critical next step. None of the admin pages are functional.
  - **Plan**:
    1.  Define Mongoose schemas for each content type (Saints, Books, Events, News, Audio, etc.).
    2.  Implement API endpoints in  for , , , and  operations for each content type.
    3.  Connect the frontend forms and tables in the admin pages (e.g., ) to these API endpoints.
    4.  Start with one module, like **Saints**, and build it end-to-end.
- **P1: Implement Admin Authentication**: The  page is a UI placeholder.
  - **Plan**: Implement a simple username/password system using JWT. Protect all  routes.
- **P2: Populate Public Pages with Dynamic Data**: All public pages are currently static.
  - **Plan**: Modify each public page (e.g., ) to fetch data from the newly created backend APIs instead of using hardcoded content.

Future Tasks:
- **P3: Implement File Uploads**: A core requirement for Books (PDFs), Audio (MP3s), and Gallery (images).
  - **Plan**: Implement functionality in the admin panel to upload files to the local server and save the paths in the database.
- **P4: Implement Remaining Content Pages**: Pages like Hamd, Naat, Dua, Urs Mubarak, Poetry, and Services still need to be created.
- **P5: Implement Donation Page**: This page requires integration with JazzCash/EasyPaisa.
  - **Plan**: Use  to get the integration details for these Pakistani payment gateways.
- **P6: Implement Contact Form**: The contact form UI needs a backend endpoint to handle submissions.

<Earlier_issues_found/mentioned_but_not_fixed>
   - Issue 1: All API endpoints in  return static or empty data (e.g., ). This was acceptable for initial UI setup but is now a blocker for any real functionality.
   - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?: The entire application's dynamic content depends on implementing real database interactions in the API. Solving this is the key to making the website functional.
   - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: backend
   - Is recurring issue? N

<All_files_of_reference>
1.  ****: The central file for all backend logic. It needs to be populated with CRUD endpoints.
2.  ****: The homepage component. It contains the flawed i18n implementation and all navigation links that might need further updates.
3.  ****: The collection of admin panel pages. These files need to be connected to the backend API to become functional.
4.  ****: The public-facing pages that need to be updated to fetch dynamic data from the API.
</All_files_of_reference>
<Areas_that_need_refactoring>
- The multilingual implementation in  is not scalable. It uses a single large, hardcoded object for all translations and manages the language via a simple React . This should be refactored into a standard i18n library approach (e.g., ) with separate language files ().
</Areas_that_need_refactoring>
<key_api_endpoints>
- No functional endpoints exist yet. The file  is a placeholder. Endpoints like , ,  need to be created.
</key_api_endpoints>
<Critical_Info_for_New_Agent>
- The project is currently a facade. A lot of UI has been built, but almost no backend functionality is in place.
- The immediate priority is to make the application data-driven. You should start by implementing the full CRUD lifecycle for one of the admin sections (e.g., Saints) to establish the pattern for the rest.
- The user has twice asked for a review of missing features, indicating they are keen on seeing the full scope of the project realized. Focus on delivering the core functionalities from the PRD.
- Do not get bogged down in minor UI tweaks. The main task is to build the backend and connect it to the existing frontend scaffolds.

<Project_Health_Check>
- Broken: The entire backend functionality is missing. No data can be created, updated, or deleted. The admin panel is non-operational.
- Mocked: All public-facing content pages (Books, Events, Gallery, etc.) are effectively mocked with static, hardcoded data. The API returns empty arrays.
</Project_Health_Check>
<3rd_Party_Integrations>
- None implemented.
- **Planned**: JazzCash/EasyPaisa for donations. The agent will need to use  to get the implementation plan for these.

<What_agent_forgot_to_execute>
- Add the Audio and Video links to the main homepage navigation after creating the pages.
- Create the Visits page, which was part of its last plan.
- Implement any backend logic or database models, which is the largest outstanding part of the project.
- Address several pages from the original PRD that have not been scaffolded yet: Hamd, Naat, Dua, Urs Mubarak, Poetry, Services.
